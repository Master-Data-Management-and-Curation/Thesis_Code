Meerkat is a tool designed to interact with the VT-STM environment set up at the STRAS laboratory, where different software running on different computers needs to interact with each other.

To use Meerkat:
1) Open the Meerkat folder
2) Install the requirements.txt on your Python environment
3) In rhk/rhk.py enter the IP address and the TCP Port for the PC where R9 software is installed
4) In eLabFTW/eLabFTW_credentials.py enter the base URL of the ElabFTW instance and your eLabFTW API key for authentication
5) In App_Paths/app_paths.py enter your save paths
6) Run run_app.py (python3 run_app.py)

In order for the interface to function properly, the .sm4 files to be processed must be organized in a hierarchical folder and subfolder structure as follows: YYYY/YYYYMMDD/STM.

In the Examples folder:
1) The "Input - STM image file" folder contains an example of an .sm4 file, which is the type of file generated by the STM acquisition software
2) The "Output - STM image file" folder contains output .png and .json files, produced using the Gallery or Update eLabFTW tools from an input .sm4 file. The STM image is saved as a .png, while the .json file contains metadata from the .sm4 file
3) The "Output - Create New Sample tool" folder contains a .json file generated using Meerkat's "Create New Sample" tool.
