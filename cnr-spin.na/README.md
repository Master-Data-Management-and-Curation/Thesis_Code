### Emanuele D'Amico

* [AMORE main branch](https://github.com/PioApocalypse/AMORE): contains fully operational AMORE with only a login BYOK system and a sample creation feature which automatically assigns our Standard-ID ("Na-25-000") to the new sample.
* [AMORE dev branch](https://github.com/PioApocalypse/AMORE/tree/dev): contains development code that's still being tested and frankly currently not even operational; experimental feature: sample tracking.
