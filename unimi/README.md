This repo contains the contributions related to E. Molteni's MDMC internship work 
on adding functionalities to some NOMAD parsers for electronic structure codes.  

In particular:

parser.py:  modified NOMAD Yambo parser where I have fixed an issue about a mismatch between 
total number of coordinates and total number of atoms.

/CH4_db_minimal:  test folder for the NOMAD electronic-parsers/test/data/yambo folder, for the above-mentioned implementation regarding atom coordinates
